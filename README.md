# EarnExx + FairScale Prototype

## Overview
EarnExx is a task-based rewards platform on Solana that allows users to earn tokens by completing verifiable tasks. This prototype demonstrates **integration with FairScale**, a Solana-based reputation system, to make **trust a first-class feature** on EarnExx. By incorporating FairScore, rewards are dynamically scaled based on wallet reputation, incentivizing honest and active participation.

## Why This Matters
- **Trust & Security:** Users are wary of task/reward platforms. FairScore ensures only reputable wallets receive higher multipliers, reducing fraud risk.  
- **Reward Optimization:** High-reputation users are rewarded for their consistent, reliable participation, creating a fair and motivating system.  
- **Solana Ecosystem Impact:** Demonstrates how on-chain reputation can be leveraged for new use-cases like tiered access, reputation-based rewards, and risk mitigation.

## Features
- Fetch FairScore for any wallet
- Adjust rewards dynamically based on reputation tiers
- Interactive frontend demo to visualize reward calculations
